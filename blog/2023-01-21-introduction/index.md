I would like to take a coffe with you and sit to draw & think.

Let me tell you that if I were to exhibit my last years works, it would undoubtedly be a exploration, an invitation to despertar your curiosity of information architectures, diagrams, data visualizations and user interfaces, with explanatory notes on complex social issues.

The hard work will be to remember all names of friends, physicists, economists, communicators, political scientists, sociologists, social leaders and human rights defenders with whom I have had the honor of sitting down to think.
