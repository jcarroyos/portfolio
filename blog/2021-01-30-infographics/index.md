From 2016 to 2021 I had the beautiful experience in the role of professor for **Infographics** at [University of Tolima](https://ut.edu.co/). I learned and shared a lot during those years of teaching.

With a practical approach, this course presents the evolution of infographics, the workshop focus on the core questions:

- what is infographics?
- what are infographics for?
- and how we can made infographics?

Based on the idea that infographics in the field of communication can be understood as a journalistic genre, during the course we explore the possibilities of creation and think on the theoretical field of image research and visual studies.
