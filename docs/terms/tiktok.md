# Tiktok portfolio data app

The TikTok Portfolio Data App includes two main products: the Follower Counter and Interaction Counter. The Follower Counter displays the total followers for a specified TikTok account, pulling public data via TikTok's API to keep your portfolio updated. The latest version improves its visual integration for responsive layout adaptability. The Interaction Counter shows total engagement (likes, comments, shares), giving a snapshot of social reach. This version also supports custom metric selection for a more tailored display. The app uses TikTokâ€™s API with read-only access, ensuring data privacy by not storing or sharing personal information, while an optimized data-fetching mechanism minimizes API requests and maintains TikTok's rate limits.
