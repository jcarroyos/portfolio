# Portfolio Intro

![Notebooks introduction to my blog](https://jcarroyos-portfolio.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/notebooks_intro-jcarroyos.jpg)

I’m what you might call a hybrid professional, someone who merges art with technology. My work revolves around the idea of connecting design with code to create digital experiences that are interactive, engaging, and, above all, that foster cultural and artistic growth. I’m passionate about creating interactive content that goes beyond traditional media, exploring immersive environments, web applications, and projects that bring together both the digital and physical worlds.

In the educational field, I teach courses on data visualization, virtual environments, and information technologies, where my main focus is on encouraging creativity. I inspire my students to explore their artistic potential using digital tools, emphasizing the design process more than programming itself, since I firmly believe that the real value lies in how we can leverage creative thinking to generate content that captures attention.

Outside the classroom, I work on diverse projects—from developing single-page web applications to designing immersive experiences for the metaverse and integrating AI-powered conversational agents into interactive websites. I am committed to the idea of using technology to promote art and culture, constantly finding new ways to blend the digital and physical worlds to create novel expressions.
