# Portfolio Intro

I am an artist and coder, also a data visualizer, and a mediator between tech teams and research teams. My role has always been to point out the value of internet technologies and visual thinking for the conceptualization of the design and definition of digital products in the cultural and memorial field.

I always carry with me a notebook to draw & think. If I were to exhibit my work, it would undoubtedly be a curation of sketches of information architectures, diagrams, data visualizations and user interfaces, with explanatory notes on the complex social issues involved in those notes by hand from the ideation processes. Would give credit to physicists, economists, communicators, political scientists, sociologists, social leaders and human rights defenders with whom I have had the honor of sitting down to think.

> In sum my daily life consists in keeping myself updated on tech trends, attending art exhibitions, and keeping attention on social concerns. This has been allowed me to be involved in digital projects thought human rights and cultural practice.
