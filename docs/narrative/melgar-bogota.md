# Melgar → Bogotá: A Melancholy Odyssey

A child wakes up alone on an unfamiliar street, wandering through a town far from home. His current reality is the consequence of his most recent actions. He tries to cling to fragments of his dreams; between flashes and echoes, he begins to reproach himself for the decisions he made. With remorse growing within him, he struggles to find his way back home. His destiny teeters on a fragile balance between wakefulness and sleep.

When the dream is shattered, the journey home begins.
