# SIMUS

📆 2019 - Music Information System

## The order

Logo creation, implementation and improvement of the user interface for the _Sistema de Información de la Música_ SIMUS at Colombian Ministry of Culture.

## The challenge

Support the activities required for the standardization, implementation and improvement of the graphic component in coordination with the Sistema Nacional de Información Cultural de Colombia (SINIC).

## The solution

From the three environments "state, market and society" a color palette and geometry for the logo was created inspired by the article [What Mathematics Can Learn From Classical Music](https://archive.schillerinstitute.com/fid_91-96/944_math_music.html)
