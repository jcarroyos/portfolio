# SCRD

ðŸ“† 2018 - eLearning for SecretarÃ­a de Cultura de BogotÃ¡

## The order

The virtual courses of the project "Cultural Communities for Peace" of the Ministry of Culture, Recreation and Sport do not intend to settle or be part of this discussion, nor are they understood as a contribution - or complement - to formal educational processes, but they do seek open fields of learning and work from the knowledge that the same communities have on various topics.

# The chalenge

The work consisted of creating a custom visual theme for Moodle, designing the entire visual package for the modules and creating the automation of activities in the course that, although it was not intended as a Massive Open Online Course, did have a large audience of more than 1500 users in training
